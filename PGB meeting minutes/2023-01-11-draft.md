### Agenda

* Call to order
  * See Previous Meeting Minutes Here
* Orbx Product Attribute Survey Update
  * Discussion of survey - not getting enough traction
  * Proposal from Todd: rather than waiting for more responses, create a minimum viable product, in some selected verticals where we have available expertise, such as maybe textile/garments.
  * Harm Jan: Apparel and Footwear industry â€“ there is an existing data model (without IPR), produced by the UN and founded by the European Commission.   Suggestion to pick this up, reuse and enhance it. The idea is to create both data models and data exchange APIs, but starting with the former.
    * OASIS will help work out issues of re-use from other models. 	
  * To come:  how will connectivity with blockchain serializations be specified/addressed?
  * To come: target connections to other verticals where there's origin tracing activity (like software/ SBOMs), or committee domain expertise.
* Working Group Updates:
  * Electronics WG - Use case on runway
  * Mining and Minerals + ESG WG
  * Trade Finance + ESG WG
  * Apparel and Footwear WG - Use case in flight
* Other business
  * Adjourn
